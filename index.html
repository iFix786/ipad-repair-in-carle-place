Everyone I went to either would say it’s not fixable or try to sell me another phone. He wasn’t wrong Nora saw the phone and assured me she could fix it and she did. Great customer service very friendly and quick repair she had the screen protector too which was really convenient since a lot of people don’t  have it.
